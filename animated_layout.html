						<h2>What is this page for?</h2>
						<!-- Let's put these two purposes into fun animated CSS boxes -->
						<p>This page has two purposes. One is to act as a method to teach myself static website design by playing around with CSS/Javascript/HTML 
							designs.<br><br>

							The other purpose is to build a portal to my programming projects which can act to summarize them by using the designs I learn from my dedication
							to improving myself in this field.
						</p>

						<h2>Why go through this trouble?</h2>
						<p>I have been learning programming practices in Java, C#, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, PHP, SQL, and XML for the last three years
							in order to one day obtain employment as a software developer. I think that it's getting close to the time where I believe in my 
							own skills enough that I can get serious about creating a presence for myself while applying for positions.<br><br>

							I believe that building this website will help give a human element to the applications I send, and I hope that someone sees this
							and can tell just how hard I am trying to get my foot in the door of this exciting field.

						<h2>Why Programming?</h2>
						<p>Initially I wasn't sure what I wanted to do when I set out to community college at the age of 27, almost 6 years ago now.<br><br>
						
						I tried accounting, and while the math wasn't hard, the backwards thinking of debits and credits was confusing for my mind, and 
						after two semesters I gave that up to try another major.<br><br>
					
						For the next year I tried out graphic design, thinking that maybe that could be an enjoyable career, but I found that I wasn't
						a good artist!<br><br>
					
						Well, I'm not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy, so I decided to switch gears to programming. I thought, "Hey, I like video games,
						it would be cool at the very least to be able to make them as a hobby." And I am extremely grateful to my past self for making that decision 
						because I realized how much I loved programming and the challenges it brings.<br><br>
					
						There is a certain rush involved when I am stuck on a difficult bug for a long time and finally fix it. I also like learning new things, and
						with programming, there is no end to new things to learn. It's also one of the first skills I ever obtained through hard work and my own determination.
						I am proud of what I have learned and that also fuels me to keep on going. I hope to become masterful in many areas of programming as time goes on.
						</p>
					</section>
					
					<section class="st-panel" id="st-panel-4">
						<div class="st-deco" data-icon="H"></div>
						<h2>What kind of employment?</h2>
						<p>I would love a career in video gaming, but as I've learned more I realize that I'm a better programmer than I am a video game developer.
							Of course, I won't give that up as a choice, and would be open to any interested parties looking for game developers. Also, it feels like getting
							an interview with a video game company has become akin to winning the lottery!<br><br>

							I am open to:
							<ul>
								<li>Entry Level Positions</li>
								<li>Internships</li>
								<li>Remote Work</li>
								<li>Software Developer Positions</li>
								<li>QA Positions</li>
								<li>Programmer Positions</li>
								<li>Webdev Positions</li>
								<li>Mobile Positions</li>
								<li>Gamedev Positions</li>
							</ul>

						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>About five years ago I decided that I was tired of following a
						certain path of hardships brought on by my own lack of motivation. I realized
						that I was living a life where I assumed that things would just eventually get
						better while simultaneously shooting myself in the foot by waiting for some
						magical motivation to come.<br><br>
						
						Instead of waiting, I decided to make my own motivation by forcing myself to learn new things,
						and eventually I landed on programming as the ultimate career choice. I used to want to be a photographer,
						and a graphic design artist, or anything really that could pay the bills beyond an entry level job. I spent
						a couple years developing those talents before I realized that I did not enjoy doing them.<br><br>
						
						But it's different for programming. I can feel it in my blood that I will never stop learning new tricks, techniques,
						and tactics for making my software development skills stronger.<br><br>
						
						I have a huge passion for solving challenging problems, and I also love video games, hoodies, and food!<br><br>
						
						If you want to get in touch with me about potential employment offers or any questions you might have,
						please contact me at korystennett@gmail.com.<br><br>
						
						Thank you for taking the time to check out my site!<br><br>
