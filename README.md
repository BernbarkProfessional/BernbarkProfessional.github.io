Resume Website

This website's purpose is to not only host proof, but also act as proof of progress in my coding "journey" over the last three years.

I am making this in hopes of putting my best foot forward and finally landing a position in software development which has been a dream of mine for all of this time.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this page, it means a lot to me!

From,

Kory Stennett
