                    <h2>Following a Brackey's tutorial on sidescrolling platformers, I branched out from regular programming 
                        in order to pursue my dream of making games. It was a rough beginning, with many pitfalls, and eventually I reached a point where I couldn't progress much further due to the poor planning in early development. However, it wasn't a waste of time, and I learned plenty of skills from this project.

                                This was an instense game meant to be a roguelike platformer with random stat and gold pickups. As you can see, the intensity was quite ridiculous, but it was my first foray into game development and I spent a lot of time and love crafting this "game".
