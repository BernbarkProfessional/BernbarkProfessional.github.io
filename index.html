										<p>Game programming is the whole reason I decided to start programming to begin with! I love it so much, even the frustrating bits where I can't figure something out. I dream to someday be a game developer making games for a company, but in the meantime I just enjoy making games as a hobby and learning tool.</p>

										Python
									</td>
									<td>
										3 Years

									<td>
										<p>I like the freedom that Python grants to the user, one of my favorite languages, and no need for Getters and Setters. (Woo hoo!)</p>
									</td>

								<tr>
									<td>
										Java
									</td>
									<td>
										3 Years
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>The second language I learned, and also the first that my school made us learn. I like Java for its structure, but I dislike certain things, such as Getters and Setters. Newer languages seem to have more features than vanilla Java.</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										C++
									</td>
									<td>
										1 Year
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>The first programming language I learned. I was using books to teach myself until school started back in 2019. I took two courses on C++ and decided I didn't like that form of programming, although I may come back to it some day. I think that learning memory handling would be good for me.</p>

									<td>
										JS/HTML/CSS
									</td>
									<td>
										2 Years
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>At first I was scared of web development, but I've discovered that it's not something to be afraid of. On the contrary, the things that we can do with CSS and Javascript combined are pretty awesome. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite things to do as a programmer.</p>
